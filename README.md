Minesweeper

    Minesweeper is a test of skill and an exercise in deductive thought. It will test, not only your skills of patterns and problem solving, but it will test your patience as well.

	The object is to pick a cell, and do your best to avoid picking a mine, which will end the game. If you choose a cell with a numeric value, it is a hint to how many mines are merely one cell away! 

	We’re writing this in Javascript, CSS, and HTML, so we’re hoping for the best… Come play the game that’s “Sweeping” the Nation (or at least this little corner of the room), and don’t step on any mines!
